# Data-Warehouse-Project

## Objective
Develop a data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

## Project Overview
This project involves:

**Data Architecture**: Designing a Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

- Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
- Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
- Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

**ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.

**Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
